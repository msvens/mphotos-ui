# MPhotos UI

A modern photo blog frontend application built with Next.js, inspired by [mellowtech.org](https://www.mellowtech.org). This application serves as the user interface for a photo blog system, connecting to a backend service through a RESTful API.

## Overview

MPhotos UI is designed to provide a clean and elegant way to showcase photographs with blog-style presentation. The frontend communicates with a dedicated backend service to manage and display photo content.

## User Roles and Authentication Model

MPhotos UI operates with a **single-owner, multi-guest** authentication model:

### **Owner/Admin User (Single User)**
- **One primary user** owns and administers the entire photo blog
- **Authentication required** for administrative functions
- **Password-based login** (no username needed)
- **Full administrative access** including:
  - Profile management (name, bio, profile picture)
  - UX configuration (grid layout, spacing, theme preferences)
  - Google Drive integration settings
  - Content management (photos, albums, cameras)
  - Guest user management and moderation

### **Guest Users (Multiple Users)**
- **Public registration** available to anyone
- **Email verification required** for activation
- **Social interaction features** including:
  - Photo comments and likes
  - Guest profile management
  - Activity tracking
- **No administrative access** - read-only for site configuration
- **Separate authentication system** from owner login

### **Authentication Flow**
1. **Owner Login**: Password-based authentication for administrative access
2. **Guest Registration**: Email-based registration with verification
3. **Session Management**: Server-side sessions with automatic cookie handling
4. **Role-Based Access**: Different UI and functionality based on user type

This model ensures that the photo blog remains under the owner's control while allowing public interaction through guest accounts.

> **Current Implementation Status**: The owner authentication system (login/logout, profile management, UX configuration) is fully implemented. Guest user functionality (registration, comments, likes) is planned for future development.

## UI Spacing System

The application uses a consistent spacing system to maintain visual hierarchy and rhythm throughout the interface. The spacing system is implemented through the `Section` component and follows these principles:

### Section Component

The `Section` component provides consistent vertical spacing between major content blocks. It accepts the following props:

- `spacing`: Controls the vertical margin between sections
  - `sm`: 2rem (32px)
  - `md`: 4rem (64px)
  - `lg`: 6rem (96px)
  - `xl`: 8rem (128px)
- `showDivider`: Optional boolean to add a divider line after the section
- `className`: Additional CSS classes for custom styling

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Top-Level Spacing**
   - The main content area starts with a fixed top margin from the navbar (96px)
   - This is handled by the `LayoutProvider` component

2. **Section Spacing**
   - Use the `Section` component to wrap major content blocks
   - Choose spacing based on content hierarchy:
     - `lg` for primary sections (e.g., Bio, PhotoGrid)
     - `md` for secondary sections (e.g., controls, filters)
     - `sm` for compact sections
     - `xl` for hero sections or major page breaks

3. **Component-Level Spacing**
   - Components should handle their internal spacing using Tailwind's spacing utilities
   - Avoid using margin utilities on components that are wrapped in `Section`

### Example

```tsx
<Section spacing="lg" showDivider>
  <Bio />
</Section>

<Section spacing="md">
  <Controls />
</Section>

<Section spacing="lg">
  <PhotoGrid />
</Section>
```

This system ensures consistent vertical rhythm throughout the application while maintaining flexibility for different content types and hierarchies.

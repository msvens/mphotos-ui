## UI Spacing System

The application uses a consistent spacing system to maintain visual hierarchy and rhythm throughout the interface. The spacing system is implemented through the `Section` component and follows these principles:

### Section Component

The `Section` component provides consistent vertical spacing between major content blocks. It accepts the following props:

- `spacing`: Controls the vertical margin between sections
  - `sm`: 2rem (32px)
  - `md`: 4rem (64px)
  - `lg`: 6rem (96px)
  - `xl`: 8rem (128px)
- `showDivider`: Optional boolean to add a divider line after the section
- `className`: Additional CSS classes for custom styling

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Top-Level Spacing**
   - The main content area starts with a fixed top margin from the navbar (96px)
   - This is handled by the `LayoutProvider` component

2. **Section Spacing**
   - Use the `Section` component to wrap major content blocks
   - Choose spacing based on content hierarchy:
     - `lg` for primary sections (e.g., Bio, PhotoGrid)
     - `md` for secondary sections (e.g., controls, filters)
     - `sm` for compact sections
     - `xl` for hero sections or major page breaks

3. **Component-Level Spacing**
   - Components should handle their internal spacing using Tailwind's spacing utilities
   - Avoid using margin utilities on components that are wrapped in `Section`

### Example

```tsx
<Section spacing="lg" showDivider>
  <Bio />
</Section>

<Section spacing="md">
  <Controls />
</Section>

<Section spacing="lg">
  <PhotoGrid />
</Section>
```

This system ensures consistent vertical rhythm throughout the application while maintaining flexibility for different content types and hierarchies.
